# How can you fully utilize this repo ?

Here I will try to follow best practices of writing code . The main points that I will focus on are : 
1. Write clean redux logic using `redux-toolkit`
2. Write unit tests using **React testing library (RTL)**
3. Mock network requests using miragejs (This will be my first time to use it )
4. Use **MaterialUI (MUI)** for creating the components as mentioned in the description 
5. Create a responsive design with the help of **tailwindcss**
